        <h1 class="section-title">Building on VISION EUROPE 2030</h1>
        <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;">
            The follow-up activities presented in this section build directly on the discussions, commitments, and
            collective insights generated during the VISION EUROPE 2030 Conference (2–3 September, Brussels). Supported
            by the European Commission, these initiatives extend the work of Vision Europe beyond Brussels, ensuring
            that its principles of collaboration, evidence-based policymaking, and global engagement continue to drive
            progress internationally. Through a series of high-level events across multiple regions, from New York to
            Yokohama, Muscat, and Kunming, the VISION EUROPE agenda is translated into concrete action, fostering
            alignment across continents and supporting more equitable, effective, and innovation-driven health systems
            worldwide.
        </p>
        <div>
            <h1 class="section-title margin-top-followup blue">United States – New York</h1>
            <h2>1. Opening Event – Italian Cultural Institute, New York</h2>
            <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;">The opening event of the Last Mile series, “The Last Mile –
                Screening, Vaccination, and Treatment:
                Driving Investment, Innovation, and Alignment,” set the tone for a global campaign focused on closing
                gaps in cancer and NCD innovation. Hosted at the Italian Cultural Institute, the session gathered
                leading speakers and delegates to examine how investment, implementation, and cooperation can accelerate
                access to prevention, early detection, and treatment.
            </p>
            <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;">This initiative builds on the substantive insights of VISION
                EUROPE 2030, reinforcing the shared
                commitment to coordinated, evidence-based policy action across regions. The event marked the first step
                of the Last Mile journey, initiating three sequential high-level dialogues in New York that together
                form a unified call to bridge the innovation-to-access divide worldwide.</p>

            <h2>2. United Nations Headquarters – Co-hosted by the Permanent Mission of the Philippines</h2>
            <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;">The second event of the Last Mile series took place at the
                United Nations Headquarters, co-hosted by the Permanent Mission of the Philippines. Bringing VISION
                EUROPE’s agenda into the heart of multilateral diplomacy, this session highlighted the urgency of
                closing global gaps in cancer and NCD innovation, with strong participation from international delegates
                and policymakers.</p>
            <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;">Building on the Brussels discussions, the event underscored the
                importance of cross-regional alignment, the need for equitable access to innovation, and the value of
                collaborative approaches to financing, data, and implementation. The strong engagement of participants
                validated the global relevance of VISION EUROPE’s priorities.</p>

            <h2>3. Permanent Mission of Switzerland to the United Nations – The Last Mile Lunch</h2>
            <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;">The series concluded with a high-level luncheon hosted by the
                Permanent Mission of Switzerland. This session brought together distinguished leaders, including France
                Dube (AstraZeneca), Lutz Hegemann (Novartis), Ruggero De Maria (Alleanza Contro il Cancro), and Prof.
                Alfred K. Njamnshi (BRAIN Initiative), to focus on the core challenge of implementation across cancer,
                NCDs, and rare diseases.</p>
            <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;">Building on VISION EUROPE, the discussion called for aligned
                governance, sustainable financing models, and equitable access strategies. The three-part Last Mile
                series created strong momentum for global collaboration, connecting European insights with worldwide
                action.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1 class="section-title margin-top-followup blue">Japan – Yokohama</h1>
            <h2>“From Pipeline to Patient: Delivering on the Promise of Precision Oncology and Beyond”</h2>
            <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;">Held alongside the ICGC-ARGO workshop in Yokohama, this
                follow-up event examined how Japan can turn
                world-class scientific capability into everyday clinical benefit. The session, titled “From Pipeline to
                Patient: Delivering on the Promise of Precision Oncology and Beyond”, focused on converting consensus
                into near-term action across early detection, stratified screening, real-world evidence, clinical
                trials, and sustainable financing.</p>
            <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;">Building on the VISION EUROPE 2030 agenda, the discussions
                emphasized the need for governance frameworks,
                interoperable data systems, value-based reimbursement, workforce capability, patient literacy, and
                responsible AI. Japan’s experience showcased feasible pathways for standardised testing, MRD deployment,
                and data-driven oncology.</p>
            <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;">A subsequent Tokyo discussion expanded the global message:
                genomics and AI require execution, not
                rhetoric. Leaders including Takayuki Yoshino and Andrew Biankin highlighted practical models that
                countries can adapt to shorten the distance between evidence and improved care. The message aligned
                strongly with VISION EUROPE’s call for implementation, equity, and actionable metrics.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1 class="section-title margin-top-followup blue">Oman – Muscat</h1>
            <h2>“Advancing Translational Education: Regional Strategies for Precision Medicine in the MENA Region”</h2>
            <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;">At the World Cancer Congress 2025 in Muscat, under the theme
                “Global Unity for Cancer Prevention: Empowering Communities,”, the VISION EUROPE agenda was advanced by
                engaging regions across the MENA area and Africa. The Congress offered a major platform for
                strengthening global partnerships and reducing disparities.</p>

            <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;">The VISION EUROPE follow-up event, “Advancing Translational
                Education: Regional Strategies for Precision Medicine in the MENA Region”, explored how training,
                communication, and regional cooperation can build readiness for precision medicine. Speakers such as
                Prof. Karim Lekadir, Fawzi Abu Rous, Lisa Strydom, and Dr. Hadi Abu Rasheed addressed key areas:
                workforce development, patient navigation, and turning global best practices into local action.</p>

            <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;">In line with Vision Europe’s objectives, the session reinforced
                that equitable access to innovation depends on education, capacity building, and sustained collaboration
                between regional and global stakeholders.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1 class="section-title margin-top-followup blue">China – Kunming</h1>
            <h2>"Keeping the Person at the Center in the Age of Intelligent Oncology"</h2>
            <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;">At the CACA–ICPC Summit in Kunming, global leaders gathered to
                examine the intersection of artificial intelligence, psycho-oncology, and human-centered cancer care.
                The session, featuring speakers like Daniela Chieffo, Christian J. Nelson, Lili Tang and Karim Lekadir,
                stressed that technological innovation must remain anchored in compassion, ethics, and patient
                partnership.</p>

            <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;">Building on VISION EUROPE 2030, the summit addressed how health
                systems can integrate AI responsibly, ensuring fairness, explainability, and trust. Discussions
                highlighted the need for governance, reimbursement frameworks, privacy protection, education,
                infrastructure, and cross-border collaboration, echoing the eight policy pillars advanced in Brussels.
            </p>

            <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;">A second session deepened this message by linking European and
                global policy efforts, reinforcing that innovation must be guided by empathy and aligned with societal
                readiness. The Kunming summit demonstrated global resonance with Vision Europe’s core principles:
                ethical innovation, equitable access, and human-centered care.</p>
